	<h1>Hyperlinks</h1>
	<p>Knowing how to link your code to other documents is important.</p>
	
	<div id="absolute">
		<h2>Absolute References</h2>
		<p>Absolute references (sometimes called external links) connected to pages in other domains.In the href attribute of the tag the full URL of the page,image,or other resource you would like to link to is specified.One example might be your quest to list some of the greatest bakeries of all time.Since you want to link to the bakeries themselves and not files you wrote, you would use an absolute reference.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">Linkedin</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>An advantage of absolute references is that you are always linked to the most up-to-date information on that page.A disadvantage is that is up to you to make sure that the links don't change.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="relative">
		<h2>Relative References</h2>
		<p>Relative references (sometimes called internal links) connect to page in other domains. In the href attribute of the tag only the folder(if any) and filename is specified.Some examples of when you might use relative references would be in your navigation bar or links to your images.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="fontawesome.html" target="_blank">Fontawesome usage</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div id="images">
		<h2>Images as links</h2>
		<p>More and more people are moving away from textual prompts to ones that are graphical based.This is because the page looks "nicer." I can redo the link above using a picture instead of words</p>
		<a href="img/donut.jfif" target="_blank">
			<img src="img/donut.jfif" alt="donut"/>
		</a>
		<p>Something to keep in mind though, is that not everyone can see the image, or they may not realize that the image is a link.As you become more confident in your coding you will want to make sure to have many people test your pages so that you can make it an optimal experience for as many people as possible.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="embedded">
		<p>Every tag can have an id attribute.The id attribute gives a name to a specific section of the DOM.You can use that id to link directly to a part of a page instead of just a page in general.This is a great way to allow people to quickly jump from one part of your page to the specific section you are looking for.Review the material on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#absolute">Absolute references</a></li>
			<li><a href="#relative">Relative references</a></li>
			<li><a href="#images">Images Links</a></li>
			<li><a href="#embedded">Embedded references</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>When you click on any of the links above, the browser will bring that section into focus.It may be the case that the bottom two links don't do anything for you.This is because this content is already in your screen.</p>
		<p>**Don't forget that you can choose "View Source" to see the code I used to create these links.</p>
